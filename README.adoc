= Spring Cloud Hystrix AMQP sample app

== Building

Build the app with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

== Running on Cloud Foundry

When running on CF, the app will expect to be bound to a Circuit Breaker service instance with the name `circuit-breaker`. Create a service instance and push the app with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ cf cs p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
$ cf push hystrix-ampq-sample
----

Once the app is running, browse to the app's route URL or `curl` the URL to drive some traffic to the app.

Browse to the PCF App Console, click on the `manage` link for the `circuit-breaker` service, and see the traffic to the sample app in the Hystrix dashboard.
